    '31772': 'The shape has 9 equal parts in total, and 3 of them are not shaded. So the unshaded fraction is $\\frac{3}{9}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{3}$.',
    '31774': 'To divide a fraction by a whole number, you multiply the fraction by the reciprocal of the whole number. So, $\\frac{1}{2} \\div 6 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12}$.',
    '31777': 'To find $\\frac{3}{5}$ of 120, you divide 120 by 5 (which is 24) and then multiply that result by 3 (which is 72).',
    '31778': 'We can simplify the fraction $\\frac{9}{15}$ to $\\frac{3}{5}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3. Then, to make the denominator 10, we multiply both the numerator and denominator of $\\frac{3}{5}$ by 2, which gives us $\\frac{6}{10}$. So, A is 6.',
    '32829': 'To solve for y, you need to get y by itself. Since y is being multiplied by 2, you divide both sides of the equation by 2, so $y = 24 \\div 2 = 12$.',
    '32833': 'To multiply a fraction by a whole number, you multiply the numerator by the whole number: $2 \\times 5 = 10$. This gives $\\frac{10}{3}$. As a mixed number, $\\frac{10}{3}$ is $3 \\frac{1}{3}$.',
    '32835': 'To compare decimals, look at the digits from left to right. All choices start with 6. Comparing the tenths place, 6.2 has a 2, which is larger than the 0s in the other numbers, making 6.2 the greatest.',
    '33471': 'If $\\frac{3}{8}$ of the balls are yellow, then $1 - \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{5}{8}$ of the balls are green. To find how many green balls there are, calculate $\\frac{5}{8}$ of 24, which is $(24 \\div 8) \\times 5 = 3 \\times 5 = 15$.',
    '33472': 'To add fractions, you need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. So, $\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{15}$ and $\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{6}{15}$. Adding them gives $\\frac{5}{15} + \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{11}{15}$.',
    '33474': "When you want to find a fraction 'of' another fraction, it means you need to multiply them. In this case, Robert eats $\\frac{1}{3}$ of Sally's $\\frac{2}{3}$ piece, so you multiply $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3}$.",
    '76870': 'The exterior angle of a regular polygon is $180 - 144 = 36$ degrees. The number of sides is found by dividing 360 degrees by the exterior angle: $360 \\div 36 = 10$ sides.',
    '89443': 'Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the positive version of that number. So, $(-8) - (-5)$ becomes $(-8) + 5$, which equals $-3$.',
    '91695': 'The number of dots increases by 4 each time (6, 10, 14, 18). So, for Pattern 5, there would be $18 + 4 = 22$ dots, and for Pattern 6, there would be $22 + 4 = 26$ dots.',
    '104665': 'This is an inverse proportion problem: more people mean less time. Calculate the total work in hours ($3 \\text{ people} \\times 192 \\text{ hours} = 576 \\text{ hours}$). Then divide this by the new number of people ($576 \\text{ hours} \\div 12 \\text{ people} = 48 \\text{ hours}$).',
    '109465': 'Probabilities range from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). A probability of 0.9 is very close to 1, meaning the event is highly likely to occur.'
